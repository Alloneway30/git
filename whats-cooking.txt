What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2025, #01; Thu, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* cc/promisor-remote-capability (2025-05-19) 5 commits
 - promisor-remote: use string constants for 'name' and 'url' too
 - promisor-remote: allow a client to check fields
 - promisor-remote: refactor how we parse advertised fields
 - promisor-remote: allow a server to advertise more fields
 - promisor-remote: refactor to get rid of 'struct strvec'

 The "promisor-remote" capability mechanism has been updated to
 allow the "partialCloneFilter" settings and the "token" value to be
 communicated from the server side.

 Expecting a reroll.

* jc/you-still-use-whatchanged (2025-05-12) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-05-22 at e79dc9090e)
 + whatschanged: list it in BreakingChanges document
 + whatchanged: remove when built with WITH_BREAKING_CHANGES
 + whatchanged: require --i-still-use-this
 + tests: prepare for a world without whatchanged
 + doc: prepare for a world without whatchanged
 + you-still-use-that??: help deprecating commands for removal

 "git whatchanged" that is longer to type than "git log --raw"
 which is its modern rough equivalent has outlived its usefulness
 more than 10 years ago.  Plan to deprecate and remove it.

 Will cook in 'next'.
